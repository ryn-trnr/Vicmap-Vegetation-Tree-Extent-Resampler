# Vicmap-Vegetation-Tree-Extent-Resampler
Python script to stitch together the entire Vicmap Vegetation Tree Extent dataset to achieve one file for full state coverage, and resample from the base resolution of 20cm to whatever resolution is input. Default is 5 metres. The dataset is described as: 'A presence/absence of tree cover dataset is derived from statewide dataset aerial photography with a minimum of 20cm pixel resolution. The mapping of tree cover was based a upon a machine learning technique. Tree cover is defined as woody vegetation greater than approximatley two metres in height.'
